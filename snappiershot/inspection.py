        Unfortunately, there currently is no known (stable) way to get the fully
          qualified function name of a static method. If the calling function is a
          static method, the unqualified function name is returned.

        Args:
            frame_index: The index of the frame of the caller function.
              This defaults to 2 as, in the case for this package, it's expected
              that the caller function calls a method on the Snapshot object, which
              in turn calls this function.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the caller function was defined within the Python REPL.
            NameError: If the call came from a python module/file and not a function.
